# Cocktail Menu Generator
**Disclaimer:** This repo is mostly for me and my alcohol-loving friends to generate cocktail menus for our get-togethers. It's not meant to be a serious project, or even used by anyone else. But if you want to use it, go ahead! (it's not gonna be properly documented or anything though)

## Usage
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Have the file `cocktails.xlsx` at the root of the project.
4. Run `python src/app.py` to generate a cocktail menu
